A Software Class (of sorts)
=============================

This repository contains support material for a software class that I'm currently developing.
The eventual goal is to be conversant with technologies throughout the full stack of web development.

The format is currently one-on-one voice chat, but I'm exploring the idea of expanding it to something a little more scalable.

You should expect this repository to be a work in progress -- that said, I welcome any questions, comments, suggestions or improvements. I'd especially like to hear from you if you have found this material useful.

Topics to be touched upon, in no particular order:  
* Tools:
  * Git / GitHub
  * VirtualBox
  * Vagrant
* Languages / etc:
  * Ruby
  * JavaScript
  * SQL
  * HTML
  * CSS
